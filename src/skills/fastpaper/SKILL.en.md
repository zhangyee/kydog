# fastpaper

A pre-installed CLI for academic search, download and reading. Verify once with
`which fastpaper`; it is NOT a Python package, never `pip install` it.

Pass `--format json` on every call. Output is `{"source": "...", "results": [...]}`
— the papers are under `results`. Exit codes are `0` success, `2` a malformed
command, `4` **nothing to return** — no such paper, no `--grep` match, no PDF
for this paper at this source, no figure files for this paper — and `1` for
everything else. Branch on `4`: it
means the request was fine and this source simply has nothing, so retry
elsewhere rather than rewording. Any field
the source did not supply is `null`, meaning **unknown**; report it as unknown
rather than filling it in.

`null` covers two opposite situations, and the record cannot tell them apart:
the source has nothing to say about that field *at all*, or it does carry the
field and has nothing for this paper. `fastpaper sources` separates them — its
`pdf_url` / `open_access` / `citations` / `community` columns say which fields
each source can fill. A `null` from a source marked `✗` means **ask a different source**; from
one marked `✓` it means the answer really is unknown. Checking that column first
is cheaper than a download attempt that was never going to work.

`community` carries social signals (upvotes, comments, organization, GitHub repo and stars, the day it was listed, linked models / datasets), **filled only by `huggingface`** and `null` everywhere else. It measures attention, not citation impact.

## Commands

```bash
# search one source
fastpaper search <source> "<query>" -n 20 --format json

# Hugging Face lists: one day / week / month ranked by upvotes, or what is hot right now (no query)
fastpaper search huggingface --top 2026-W38 -n 30 --format json
fastpaper search huggingface --trending --format json

# metadata for one paper; source inferred from the identifier shape
fastpaper get <DOI|arXiv_ID|PMID|PMC_ID>
fastpaper get <source> <id>                 # or name the source

# save a PDF (default ./papers/<id>.pdf)
fastpaper download <id> [-d <dir>] [--overwrite]

# save the authors' original figure files (default ./papers/<id>/)
fastpaper figures <id> -d papers/ [--overwrite]

# citation edges — who cites this, or what it cites
fastpaper cite <id> [--direction incoming|outgoing] [-n 20]

# extract text from a PDF already on disk
fastpaper read papers/<id>.pdf --list-sections        # which sections are there
fastpaper read papers/<id>.pdf [--section methods] [--max-length 4000]

fastpaper sources --capabilities            # what each source supports, live
```

`get` routes a bare identifier by its shape: arXiv→`arxiv`, PMC→`pmc`,
PMID→`pubmed`, DOI→`crossref`, `S2:`→`semantic`.

`download` routes a bare identifier by its shape: arXiv→`arxiv`, PMC→`pmc`,
DOI→`semantic`; a PMID or a URL is rejected outright. Naming the source —
`fastpaper download europepmc <id>` — overrides the routing.

**The two disagree on DOIs, on purpose**: `get` sends one to `crossref`, the
registrar with the most authoritative metadata, and `download` sends it to
`semantic`, which resolves open access copies — crossref serves no files. The
consequence for you is that `get <DOI>` shows a crossref record whose `pdf_url`
is always `null`, while `download <DOI>` uses a link from a semantic record you
never saw. **Do not read `pdf_url` from `get <DOI>` to predict whether
`download` will work.** To see the link download would use, ask that source
directly: `fastpaper get semantic DOI:<doi>`.

`cite` routes a bare DOI→`openalex` (no key needed), and arXiv or `S2:` ids→
`semantic`. For astronomy and physics use `fastpaper cite ads <bibcode>` (needs
`ADS_API_TOKEN`; most-cited first). Those three are the only sources here that
carry citation edges.

`figures` fetches the authors' **original** figure files — an arXiv source
package or a Europe PMC supplementary package — it does not extract images
from the PDF, render anything, or parse figure numbers. Only `arxiv` and
`europepmc` can provide them; a PMC ID or a DOI both route to `europepmc` (a
DOI is resolved to a PMC ID first). Naming any other source is exit `1`; a
paper with no figure files at a supported source is exit `4`. **Filenames are
kept exactly as they appear in the archive, so they do not correspond to
figure numbers** — for `2511.11035`, the file `3.pdf` is actually Figure 1;
do not assume `1.pdf` is Figure 1. Measured on a 39-paper corpus, verified
end-to-end on 2026-08-20: 31 papers (79%) yielded figure files, so treat a
`4` here as normal, not as a sign something is broken.

`read` sections: abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion,
conclusion, references, full.

**A PDF records no section structure** — `--section` infers it from the
typography, so it can fail to find a section on an unusual layout. It exits 4
rather than returning something else, but **check before you quote**: run
`fastpaper read <pdf> --list-sections` first, and only ask for a section that
appears in the list. Under `--format json` a section read reports the heading
its slice began at (`heading.text`, `heading.offset`), which is what you
verify a quotation against.

**When the list has no `abstract` or `introduction`**, that is usually the
paper, not the tool: Nature and its family print the abstract with no heading
over it at all. Read the opening instead — it is the same few thousand
characters you were after:

```
fastpaper read papers/<id>.pdf --max-length 3000
```

The point of `--section` is to keep the paper out of your context, and the
opening of a paper is its abstract and the start of its introduction. Falling
back to it costs the same as the section would have.

Two limits to plan around. Running heads, folios and journal footers are left
in the text and can land in the middle of a quoted sentence — strip them
yourself if you are quoting. And "the section was found" is not "the section
is right": if a passage matters, confirm it with
`--section full --grep '<phrase>'`.

**Search filters** — every one is validated per source. Asking for one a source
cannot honour is a hard error that names what it *does* support **and which
sources do have the filter you asked for**, so a filter is never silently
dropped and the retry is written out for you. That message is on stderr — never
run these commands with `2>/dev/null`, or an exit code is all you get back:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-n <N>` | max results (per-source caps differ; zenodo is 25) |
| `--offset <N>` | skip N; several sources require a multiple of `-n` |
| `--sort relevance\|date` + `--order asc\|desc` | ordering — not every source accepts `--sort`; those that do not raise an explicit error |
| `--sort citations` | **only `europepmc`, `semantic`, `crossref`, `openalex`, `openaire`, `inspire`, `ads` have citation counts to sort on**, and that is the whole list; the rest either raise an explicit error (`arxiv`, `pubmed`, `pmc`, `zenodo`, `hal`, `osf`, `osti`) or do not take `--sort` at all. When in doubt run `fastpaper sources --capabilities`, whose Notes spell it out per source |
| `--year <YYYY>` · `--after <YYYY-MM-DD>` · `--before <YYYY-MM-DD>` | dates |
| `--author "<name>"` | author — *not* on `semantic`, `osf`, `eric`, `osti`, `ntrs`, `datacite`, `huggingface`, `openreview`; put the name in the query there |
| `--field <code>` | subject/category — takes a *source-specific code*, see below; openreview takes a venue code (`ICLR.cc/2025/Conference`), ads a database (`astronomy` / `physics` / `general`) |
| `--open-access` | OA only |
| `--patents` | **patents only** (europepmc) |
| `--trending` | **`huggingface` only**: what is hot right now, in Hugging Face's own order; takes no query |
| `--top <period>` | **`huggingface` only**: one day `2026-09-18` / ISO week `2026-W38` / month `2026-08`, ranked by upvotes; takes no query |
| `-o <file>` | write to a file instead of stdout |

**Env vars.** `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL` is required by unpaywall and `ADS_API_TOKEN` by
ads (without it the call exits 1 before sending anything). `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY`
and `CORE_API_KEY` lift those two out of the throttled tier. `FASTPAPER_EMAIL`
joins the polite pool for crossref/openalex. Also `NCBI_API_KEY`, `OPENALEX_API_KEY`.
`HF_TOKEN` is optional and only raises Hugging Face's rate limit.

## Examples

```bash
# arXiv rewrites the query string, so category and date go in flags
fastpaper search arxiv "attention mechanism" --field cs.CL --after 2023-01-01 -n 20 --format json

# PubMed takes Entrez syntax verbatim — publication type and MeSH
fastpaper search pubmed 'CRISPR AND systematic review[pt] AND humans[mh]' -n 20 --format json

# Europe PMC: threshold on citations, then sort by them
fastpaper search europepmc 'CRISPR AND CITED:[500 TO *]' --sort citations -n 20 --format json

# patents only
fastpaper search europepmc "gene editing" --patents -n 10 --format json

# one paper: metadata, an OA link, the file, the text
fastpaper get 10.1038/nature12373 --format json
fastpaper get unpaywall 10.1038/nature12373 --format json     # → .pdf_url
fastpaper download 1706.03762 -d papers/
fastpaper read papers/1706.03762.pdf --section methods --max-length 4000

# citation edges
fastpaper cite 10.1038/nature12373 --direction incoming -n 30 --format json
```

## Finding trends: Hugging Face lists

Hugging Face Papers is where the AI community picks and upvotes papers every day. It answers "what are people paying attention to", **not** "which paper has impact" — for impact read `citations` from `semantic` / `openalex`.

| The user asks for | Command |
|---|---|
| One day's hot papers | `fastpaper search huggingface --top 2026-09-18 --format json` |
| This week / last week | `--top 2026-W38` (compute the current week with `date +%G-W%V`) |
| This month / last month | `--top 2026-08 -n 1000` |
| What is hot right now | `--trending` |

- Daily lists exist only on weekdays. Zero results on a weekend is normal; ask for the nearest weekday.
- Weeks go W01–W52 only; W53 (the week of 2026-12-28) is an error — ask for its days instead.
- `--top` is ranked by upvotes. `--trending` is Hugging Face's own hotness order and mixes in papers that took off again years later — **do not re-rank it by upvotes, and do not present it as "this month's list"**.
- A query cannot be combined with `--top` / `--trending` (exit 2).

**Hot papers on one topic in one period**: write the whole list to a file, then filter. Do not read a month of JSON into context — about 900 papers, hundreds of KB:

```bash
fastpaper search huggingface --top 2026-08 -n 1000 --format json -o hf-2026-08.json
jq -r '.results[] | select((.title+" "+(.abstract//"")) | test("agent";"i")) | [.community.upvotes, .id, .title] | @tsv' hf-2026-08.json | head -20
```

**Reading `community`**:

- Compare `upvotes` only within one list. Votes accumulate: this week's papers have fewer than last month's by construction, and Monday's have had days more than Friday's.
- `github_stars`'s `null` means no repo is linked on Hugging Face — that's the real state, not a gap. `linked_models` (and `linked_datasets`, `linked_spaces`) are always `null` in lists and search; only `fastpaper get huggingface <id>` fills them, and once it does, `0` means none linked.
- `organization` is the publishing lab — good for "what has lab X put out lately".
- The lists are community-picked and lean to LLMs, multimodal, generative and agents. **Not being listed does not mean unimportant, let alone that nobody works on it.**

**After you have the list**:

- The abstract is already in each record — **do not `get arxiv` them one by one**: arXiv lets one request through every 3 seconds, so 30 papers take a minute and a half.
- The `id` is the arXiv id: `fastpaper download <id>` fetches the PDF, and downloads are not queued.
- Was it accepted at a venue? `fastpaper search openreview "<title words>"` and read `venue` (`ICLR 2025 Poster` = accepted, `Submitted to …` = not).
- Scholarly impact: `fastpaper cite <id>` or `semantic`.

**When reporting**, state which list (which day, week or month, or right now), how many from the top, and that this is Hugging Face community attention, not citation impact.

## Choosing a source

Two independent axes. **Discipline coverage** decides what gets found at all;
**capability** decides whether a hit can be ranked, resolved or fetched. The
cross-discipline sources hold almost all the capability — `citations` on nearly
every hit (`semantic`, `openalex`), the most precise title→DOI lookup
(`crossref`), the highest OA full-text hit rate (`core`) — so they are not a
fallback behind the specialist sources, they answer a different question. For
several fields below there is no specialist source at all, and they are the
only option.

| Field | Dedicated sources | Cross-discipline sources that serve it well |
|---|---|---|
| CS · AI · ML | `arxiv` (`cs.*`), `dblp`, `openreview` (submissions and decisions, rejected and withdrawn too), `huggingface` (community attention, see above) | `semantic` (best CS coverage of the three, with citations), `openalex` |
| Math · physics · stats · quant bio/fin/econ | `arxiv` (`math.*` `physics.*` `stat.*` `q-bio.*` `q-fin.*` `econ.*` `eess.*`) | `openalex` `core` `hal` |
| Mathematics (published record) | `zbmath` (MSC classes + reviews, 1868 onwards) | `crossref` `openalex` |
| High-energy physics | `inspire` (surest citation counts; `--sort citations` works) | `arxiv` `openalex` |
| Astronomy · astrophysics | `ads` (needs `ADS_API_TOKEN`; surest citation counts, `--sort citations`, citation edges) | `arxiv` (`astro-ph`) `openalex` |
| Biomedicine · clinical | `pubmed` `pmc` `europepmc` (bioRxiv / medRxiv preprints go through it too, see below) | `semantic` `openalex` |
| Chemistry · materials · engineering | — | `openalex` `semantic` `crossref` `core` |
| Earth · environment · agriculture | `europepmc 'SRC:AGR'` (Agricola) | `openalex` `core` `doaj` |
| Humanities · social science | `oapen` (open access academic books) | `openalex` `core` `doaj` `hal` (strong on French/European work) |
| Psychology · sociology · education · law (preprints) | `osf --field psyarxiv` (or `socarxiv` / `edarxiv` / `lawarxiv`) | `openalex` `core` |
| Education research | `eric` | `openalex` `core` `doaj` |
| Technical reports · grey literature | `osti` (US DOE), `ntrs` (NASA aerospace) | `core` |
| Datasets · software · theses | `datacite` `zenodo` | `openaire` |
| Japanese journals | `jstage` (Japanese society journals; Japanese titles where they exist) | `crossref` |
| Chinese journals | — | **none.** `europepmc`'s `LANG:chi` and `SRC:CBA` do not count as Chinese journal coverage — see below |
| Patents | `europepmc --patents` | — |

`PDF` = `fastpaper download` works against this source. A `—` does not mean no
full text is reachable: `openalex` and `doaj` return a `pdf_url` on some hits
that you can fetch yourself. It means the CLI will not
fetch it for you.

`Cites` = does `citations` come back populated. `✓` nearly every hit · `~` only
under some conditions · `0` field present but 0 on most records · `—` never.

Even on a `✓` PDF source an individual record may hold no file — `pdf_url` is
`null` and the download fails with "No PDF URL found", **exit 4**. That is
normal rather than a fault.

**A `403` is a different thing and worth reading, not retrying.** The message
names the host and prints the full URL:

```
Error: 403 from www.mdpi.com
https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/16/5542/pdf?version=1629270899
The server refused this request. fastpaper cannot tell a paywall from a bot
block here -- they look the same from outside. ...
```

Do **not** loop over other sources after one of these. Measured: that MDPI
paper is fully open access and still 403s, an AHA subscription paper 403s
identically, and Semantic Scholar reports `open_access: true` for both — so
the status tells you nothing about whether a free copy exists. And the
alternatives are not independent: unpaywall resolves that DOI to the *same*
publisher URL byte for byte, and `download europepmc <DOI>` lands on it too.
Report the URL to the user instead; exit is `1`, not `4`.

| Source | PDF | Figures | Cites | Use it for | Watch out |
|---|:--:|:-----:|:--:|---|---|
| `arxiv` | ✓ | ✓ | — | **CS, AI, math, physics, stats, q-bio, q-fin, econ** preprints, every one of them free to read | query syntax is rewritten — see below. `pdf_url` on every hit, but a DOI on only about half |
| `pubmed` | — | — | — | **biomedicine**, 35M+ records — the reference index for clinical and life-science work | abstracts only, no PDFs and no journal name; move to `pmc` or `europepmc` for either |
| `pmc` | ✓ | — | — | **biomedical full text** (NLM) — the OA subset of what pubmed indexes | PDFs come from the OA subset only, so a pubmed hit may have no pmc record |
| `europepmc` | ✓ | ✓ | ~ | **widest biomedical** — 45M+ abstracts, 9M+ full text, plus EPO patents, NICE guidelines, Agricola and preprints | richest query syntax here, and the only source that can threshold on citations (`CITED:[N TO *]`). Relevance-ranked hits are mostly uncited, so sort or threshold explicitly when you want impact |
| `semantic` | ✓ | — | ✓ | **cross-discipline**, and the surest citation counts here — the basis for any ranking by impact | throttles hard without `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY`. Carries a DOI on most hits and a PDF on about half |
| `openalex` | — | — | ✓ | **cross-discipline**, 200M+ works | `--field` takes a concept ID (`C154945302`), not a name. Rarely carries a PDF link — good for finding and ranking, not for fetching. Relevance drifts on title lookups |
| `crossref` | — | — | ✓ | **cross-discipline** DOI registry — the best title→DOI lookup here | registered metadata only: no PDFs, no OA status, and an abstract on few hits. Use it to resolve, then go elsewhere for content |
| `dblp` | — | — | — | **computer science** bibliography — conference and journal records, curated and clean | `url` is the publisher's landing page (the dblp record page only when it has none). no abstracts at all; metadata only. **Searches title words only**: every word must appear in the title, matched as a prefix (`network` finds `Networks`; end a word with `$` for the exact word). Names and venues in the query match nothing — use `--author` and `--year`; venues cannot be filtered. Ranked shortest-title-first, not by citations. The old `year:` `author:` `venue:` syntax is an error |
| `core` | ✓ | — | 0 | **cross-discipline** OA aggregate, 400M+ from repositories and journals — a PDF on nearly every hit | a DOI on few hits and no journal name. `CORE_API_KEY` lifts the rate limit |
| `openaire` | — | — | ✓ | **cross-discipline** EU open science graph | `download` does not work here, but a `pdf_url` comes back on the minority of hits where a publisher file link is on record — most of its links are DOI resolvers and are not offered as PDFs. `get` wants an OpenAIRE id, not a DOI |
| `doaj` | — | — | — | **cross-discipline** peer-reviewed OA journals — complete metadata, with a journal name and abstract on nearly every hit | **its `pdf_url` is a landing page, not a file** — fetching one returns HTML. Year granularity only, no sorting |
| `hal` | ✓ | — | — | **cross-discipline** French national archive, with an abstract on nearly every hit and full text on most | `--field` takes a domain code: `math` `phys` `chim` `sdv` `shs` `spi` `info` `sde`. No journal name, and some records are metadata-only — filter on `pdf_url` before downloading |
| `osf` | ✓ | — | — | **social science, psychology, education and law preprints** — one API over ~32 communities (PsyArXiv, SocArXiv, EdArXiv, EcoEvoRxiv, engrXiv, MetaArXiv, Thesis Commons…), disciplines nothing else here reaches | **searches titles only**; the API has no full-text search (`filter[q]` returns 400). Every hit carries a DOI and a downloadable PDF. `--field` takes a provider id; `--offset` must be a multiple of `-n`. **The API itself is slow — 12–16s for one search** in testing; it is not hung |
| `inspire` | — | — | ✓ | **high-energy physics** — the surest citation counts here, and `--sort citations` really works | overlaps arXiv almost entirely; the value is citations and author disambiguation. `pdf_url` points at arXiv, where the file is, so `download` is off — fetch it by arXiv id |
| `zbmath` | — | — | — | **published mathematics** — 1868 onwards with MSC classes and reviews; arXiv has only preprints, so this complements it | **no abstracts** (it publishes reviews, not author abstracts), no full text, no citation counts. `--author` uses an `au:` prefix; `--offset` must be a multiple of `-n` |
| `eric` | ~ | ~ | — | **education research** — the US Department of Education index; this discipline is otherwise a blank here | only the ERIC-hosted subset (`e_fulltextauth=1`) has a `pdf_url` and `open_access`; both are null on the rest. **Never carries a DOI.** `--offset` is a true record offset |
| `osti` | ~ | ~ | — | **US Department of Energy technical reports** — grey literature nothing else here covers | `open_access` follows whether the record has a fulltext link. Date filters are converted to `MM/DD/YYYY` internally. `--offset` must be a multiple of `-n` |
| `ntrs` | ~ | ~ | — | **NASA aerospace reports** | the API **ignores every page-size parameter and always returns 10 per page**, so a larger `-n` costs one request per 10. **Never carries a DOI** (report numbers are not DOIs). `--offset` is a true record offset |
| `datacite` | — | — | — | **the DOI registry for datasets, software and theses** — the half crossref does not cover, including many university theses and repository deposits | registry metadata only: no full text, no access status. `--year` rides in the query because its own `publication-year` parameter **is silently ignored**. `--offset` must be a multiple of `-n` |
| `zenodo` | ✓ | — | — | **cross-discipline** CERN general-purpose repository — papers, datasets and software, with a DOI on nearly every hit | `-n` capped at 25. No journal name, and some records are metadata-only |
| `huggingface` | — | — | — | **AI community attention** — daily / weekly / monthly lists and what is hot now; see "Finding trends" | every paper is an arXiv paper: `pdf_url` points at arXiv, download with `fastpaper download <id>`. Keyword search caps `-n` at 120, ranks by relevance, classics first. `citations` is always null; votes are in `community` |
| `openreview` | — | — | — | **ML conference submissions and their decisions** (ICLR, NeurIPS, …), rejected and withdrawn ones too | **search only**: single records and PDFs sit behind a bot challenge, so `pdf_url` needs a browser. `venue` carries the outcome (`Submitted to ICLR 2024` = not accepted). Without `--field`, journal records imported from dblp are mixed in. The API ignores sorting, and on 2026-09-05 it blocked search entirely |
| `jstage` | ✓ | — | — | **Japanese society journals** — the Japanese-language literature | Japanese title when the record has one (authors and journal follow). **No abstracts.** Dates: `--year` only. A few journals need a subscription and 403 on download |
| `oapen` | ✓ | — | — | **open access academic books and chapters**, mostly humanities and social science | chapter titles start with `Chapter`, and a chapter is sometimes filed twice. An edited volume lists its editors, marked `(ed.)`. `-n` caps at 100 (slow API). The query takes `dc.title:` and similar clauses |
| `ads` | ✓ | — | ✓ | **astronomy and physics** (NASA ADS / SciX) — the surest citation counts and edges for the field | **needs `ADS_API_TOKEN`** (5000 a day). The query passes ADS syntax through. Download tries the arXiv copy, ADS's scan of old journals (a first request can take a minute), then the publisher's. `cite ads <bibcode>` |
| `unpaywall` | — | — | — | **DOI → a downloadable URL.** No search, no discipline — a resolver | needs `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL`; one DOI per call, and the URL must be fetched separately |

**One field that lies.** `core` returns `citations` but leaves it 0 on most
records. The source does not accept `--sort` in the first place (it raises an
explicit error), so what this catches is **ranking the returned JSON yourself**:
it looks sorted while silently burying the well-cited papers. And `arxiv`
carries a DOI on only about half its records, so a DOI is not a stable key
across sources.

### Content types worth routing on

Most content-type distinctions are not actionable. These are:

| Need | How |
|---|---|
| **Patents only** | `--patents` on `europepmc` |
| **Chinese journals** | **fastpaper does not cover Chinese journals.** Europe PMC's `LANG:chi` is only the English bibliographic records of the few Chinese journals MEDLINE indexes (titles are English translations in square brackets); `SRC:CBA` (Chinese Biological Abstracts) holds some 140k records from 2000–2007 only and stopped long ago. Neither counts as a Chinese journal search, and finding nothing here **does not** mean the Chinese literature has nothing. Leave Chinese journals to the caller's other channels (they need a browser and are outside this CLI) |
| **Preprints** | `arxiv`; bioRxiv / medRxiv via `europepmc '<terms> AND SRC:PPR AND PUBLISHER:"bioRxiv"'` (or `"medRxiv"`), other preprint servers via `europepmc 'SRC:PPR'`. Europe PMC holds nearly every preprint from both servers, though the newest few days may not be in yet. Filter on `PUBLISHER`, not a DOI prefix — new bioRxiv preprints use `10.64898/`. The CLI no longer has separate `biorxiv` / `medrxiv` sources: their API cannot search by keyword, so one search paged a date window for a minute or more |
| **Clinical guidelines** | `europepmc 'SRC:CTX'` (NICE) |

`--patents` means patents only: with the flag you get patents, without it none,
never a mix. `europepmc` narrows natively and is the only source that takes the
flag — the rest either carry no patents at all, or their own switch can only
*widen* results to mix patents in, never narrow to them, so the CLI leaves it off.

## Query syntax differs per source

This is the highest-leverage thing to get right, and the failure is silent.

**`arxiv` rewrites your query.** Every word becomes `all:{word}`, so `cat:cs.CL`
or `ti:"..."` inside the query string does nothing useful and returns unrelated
results **without any error**. Use the flags instead — `--field`, `--author`,
`--after`/`--before`.

arXiv categories for `--field`: `cs.CL` `cs.LG` `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`,
`math.*`, `physics.*`, `q-bio.*`, `q-fin.*`, `econ.*`, `stat.ML`, `eess.*`.

**`europepmc`, `pubmed`, `pmc`, `doaj`, `zenodo`, `hal`, `core`, `ads` and
`oapen` pass your query through verbatim**, so their own field syntax works:

- `pubmed` / `pmc`: `[pt]` publication type · `[mh]` MeSH · `[tiab]` title/abstract · `[au]` author · `[dp]` date
- `europepmc`: `CITED:[N TO *]` · `AUTH:` · `PUB_YEAR:` · `OPEN_ACCESS:y` · `HAS_FT:y` · `LANG:` · `KW:` · `PUBLISHER:` (preprint server, e.g. `"bioRxiv"`) · `SRC:` subsets (`PPR` preprints, `CTX` NICE guidelines, `AGR` Agricola, `CBA` Chinese Biological Abstracts (2000–2007 only, discontinued), `MED`, `PMC`)
- `doaj`: Lucene on `bibjson.*` · `zenodo`: Elasticsearch · `hal`: Solr
- `ads`: `title:` · `abs:` · `author:"^Hubble"` (`^` = first author) · `property:refereed` · `pubdate:[2023-06 TO *]` · `oapen`: `dc.title:` · `dc.contributor.author:` · `dc.date.issued:`

**`crossref`, `openalex`, `semantic` are free-text only** —
relevance matching, no field syntax. Filter them with the CLI flags. `jstage`
takes space-separated words that must all appear; `openreview` and
`huggingface` are free text too.

## Rate limits

Each `fastpaper search` is one process against one source, so a source that
fails or is throttled takes down only itself.

| Tier | Sources | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| **A — generous** | `europepmc` `crossref` `openalex` `dblp` `doaj` `zenodo` `hal` `openaire` `osf` `inspire` `zbmath` `eric` `osti` `ntrs` `datacite` `openreview` `jstage` `oapen` | no auth needed |
| **arXiv — one at a time** | `arxiv` (`search`, `get`) | arXiv allows one request every 3 seconds over a single connection, counted across every machine the caller controls |
| **A with a key** | `semantic` (`SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY`: 1 req/s → 100), `core` (`CORE_API_KEY`) | without a key both have to be treated as serial-only — anonymous `semantic` has been observed failing outright with "rate limited after 5 retries" |
| **B — shared budget** | `pubmed` + `pmc` | one NCBI E-utilities budget between them: 3 req/s, 10 with `NCBI_API_KEY` |
| **Hugging Face** | `huggingface` | 500 requests per 5 minutes per IP anonymously; `HF_TOKEN` raises it |
| **A — key required** | `ads` (`ADS_API_TOKEN`) | 5000 a day per token, reset at 00:00 UTC; once spent the call errors — do not retry |

**Put at most one `arxiv` call (`search` or `get`) in any batch of parallel
calls**; it can run alongside calls to other sources. The CLI queues arXiv
requests from every fastpaper process on the machine and spaces them at least
3 seconds apart, so extra ones are not faster — they just wait their turn — and
you do not need to sleep between rounds yourself. `download` / `figures` fetch
files from arxiv.org and are not queued. When arXiv rate-limits you (429), the
error says how long to wait — do that rather than retrying straight away with a
reworded query.

## What this tool cannot do

1. **No impact factors.** No source provides JIF or quartiles.
2. **Citation edges come only from `semantic`, `openalex` and `ads`**, via `cite`.
   Anything else you assemble (shared authors, venue, concepts) is a proxy — say
   so when you report it.
3. **It cannot fetch an arbitrary URL.** A `pdf_url` from `unpaywall` or
   `openalex` has to be downloaded with something else.
4. **Missing fields mean unknown**, not zero and not absent.
